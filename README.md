=============

These rulers have been designed using LaTeX and the PGFPlots package by Christian Feuersanger to measure slope on a 1:25,000 scale or 1:50,000 topographic map.

Slope is determined by comparing the distance between contour lines of the map with the reference lines on the edges of the ruler. The top border of the ruler is designed to measure slope with a 20 meter contour interval. The bottom border measures slope with a 50 meter contour interval.

You should print this ruler on white or transparent paper, taking care of deactivating any scaling options. Check the actual size of the ruler in centimeters on the right border.
